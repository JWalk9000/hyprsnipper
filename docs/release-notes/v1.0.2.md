# HyprSnipper v1.0.2

Date: 2025-11-02

This release focuses on stabilizing our AppImage packaging so users can run HyprSnipper without installing Python or Qt.

## Highlights

- Reliable AppImage build using PyInstaller + appimagetool fallback (avoids flaky linuxdeploy python plugin)
- Bundled libpython3.13 and PySide6/Qt libraries inside the AppImage
- Fixed AppImage desktop/icon validation issues:
  - Desktop file is placed at AppDir root for appimagetool
  - Sanitized Categories to `Graphics;` for menu cleanliness
  - Top-level `hyprsnipper.svg` added, and optional 256x256 PNG + `.DirIcon` generated when ImageMagick is present
- Removed Qt TIFF plugin to prevent `libtiff.so.5` runtime dependency problems

## Notes

- AppStream metadata is not included for now to keep builds green; a refined file will be added in a future release once it validates cleanly with appstreamcli.
- You still need these host tools for full functionality: `grim`, `slurp`, `wl-clipboard`, and Hyprland's `hyprctl`.

## Checksums

A SHA256 checksum is provided alongside the AppImage in the `dist/` folder.

## Thanks

Thanks to everyone helping test packaging across distros and environments!
